# Hindi Text Recognition Project

## Overview

This project provides a Flask-based web application for recognizing Hindi text from images, supporting both handwritten (HWT) and rendered text. It leverages a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) model for text recognition, trained on custom datasets (`HindiSeg` for handwritten text and `SplitDataset` for rendered text). The application includes dynamic model selection, automatically choosing the most recent model file based on the date in the filename (e.g., `HWT_recognition_model_20250518.pth` for a model saved on May 18, 2025). If no dated model is found, it falls back to the default model (e.g., `HWT_recognition_model.pth`).

Key features:
- Supports recognition of handwritten Hindi words (HWT) and rendered Hindi text.
- Web interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
- Dynamic model selection based on the most recent dated model file.
- Logging of predictions with feedback mechanism.
- Training scripts to fine-tune or retrain models on custom datasets.

## How It Works

This project enables Hindi text recognition through a combination of a web interface and deep learning models. Here's a step-by-step overview of its working:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The project uses two datasets: `HindiSeg` for handwritten Hindi words (HWT) and `SplitDataset` for rendered Hindi text. Each dataset contains images of Hindi words along with corresponding labels in `train.txt` and `val.txt` files.
2. **Model Training**: The CRNN model is trained using `train/HWT_V2_modified.py` for HWT and `train/Text_V2_modified.py` for rendered text. The model is trained with CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss, which allows it to handle variable-length sequences without explicit character segmentation.
3. **Model Saving**: Trained models are saved with a date suffix (e.g., `HWT_recognition_model_20250518.pth`) in the `webapp/essential/models/` directory.
4. **Web Application**:
   - The Flask app (`webapp/app.py`) provides a web interface for users to upload images.
   - The app dynamically selects the most recent model for the chosen recognition type (HWT or rendered text).
   - Uploaded images are preprocessed (resized, padded, and normalized) and passed through the CRNN model for prediction.
   - Predictions are decoded using a greedy CTC decoder and displayed alongside the uploaded images.
   - Users can provide feedback on prediction accuracy, which is logged in `webapp/static/logs/predictions.json`.
5. **Evaluation**: Test images in `data/test/` can be used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on handwritten and rendered Hindi text.

## Model Information

### Architecture

The project uses a **CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)** model, which combines convolutional layers for feature extraction with recurrent layers for sequence modeling. The architecture is designed to handle variable-length text inputs, making it ideal for text recognition tasks. Below is the detailed structure:

- **CNN Component**:
  - **Conv1**: 1 input channel (grayscale), 64 output channels, 3x3 kernel, padding=1, followed by BatchNorm and ReLU.
  - **MaxPool1**: 2x2 pooling.
  - **Conv2**: 64 input channels, 128 output channels, 3x3 kernel, padding=1, followed by BatchNorm and ReLU.
  - **MaxPool2**: 2x2 pooling.
  - **Conv3**: 128 input channels, 256 output channels, 3x3 kernel, padding=1, followed by BatchNorm and ReLU.
  - **Conv4**: 256 input channels, 256 output channels, 3x3 kernel, padding=1, followed by BatchNorm and ReLU.
  - **Conv5**: 256 input channels, 256 output channels, 9x3 kernel, padding=(0,1), followed by BatchNorm and ReLU.
  - The CNN outputs a feature map of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width), which is squeezed and permuted to (batch_size, width, channels) for the RNN.

- **RNN Component (BLSTM)**:
  - Two bidirectional LSTM layers with 256 input size and 512 hidden size.
  - Processes the sequential features from the CNN, capturing dependencies in the text.

- **Linear Layer**:
  - Maps the BLSTM output (1024 dimensions, due to bidirectional LSTM) to the number of classes (number of characters + 1 for the blank label).
  - A dropout layer (0.3) is applied before the linear layer to prevent overfitting.

- **Output**: The model outputs a sequence of logits for each time step, which are decoded using CTC.

The detailed architecture is visualized below:

### Method

- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to a fixed height (36 pixels) while preserving the aspect ratio, then padded to a fixed width (128 pixels) with white padding. Data augmentation (random rotation, affine translation, color jitter) is applied during training to improve robustness.
- **Training**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. CTC loss is used to align the predicted sequence with the ground truth without requiring character-level segmentation. Early stopping is implemented based on validation loss, with a patience parameter to halt training if no improvement is observed.
- **Inference**: During inference, the model outputs a sequence of logits, which are decoded using a greedy CTC decoder to produce the final text prediction. The decoder removes blank labels and repeated characters to generate the predicted Hindi text.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on a validation set during training, and accuracy is computed by comparing the predicted text with the ground truth. Random samples are printed after each epoch to monitor performance.

## CRNN and CTC Loss

### CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)

CRNN is a hybrid neural network architecture that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It is particularly well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like text recognition, where the input (an image) contains a sequence of characters that need to be predicted.

- **Why CRNN?**: The CNN extracts spatial features from the input image, such as edges and patterns, which are crucial for identifying characters. These features are then fed into an RNN (specifically a bidirectional LSTM in this project), which models the sequential nature of text, capturing dependencies between characters. Finally, a linear layer maps the RNN outputs to character probabilities.
- **In This Project**: The CRNN model processes grayscale images of Hindi text, extracting features through a series of convolutional layers and modeling the sequence with a BLSTM. This allows the model to handle variable-length text without requiring character segmentation.

### CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification)

CTC loss is a critical component for training models on sequence prediction tasks where the alignment between the input and output sequences is unknown, such as in text recognition.

- **What is CTC?**: CTC loss enables the model to predict a sequence of labels (characters) from an unsegmented input (image) by introducing a "blank" label and allowing multiple possible alignments between the predicted sequence and the ground truth. It computes the probability of all possible alignments and optimizes the model to maximize the likelihood of the correct sequence.
- **How It Works**: During training, the CRNN model outputs a sequence of logits for each time step (width of the feature map). CTC loss aligns these logits with the ground truth text by summing over all possible alignments that collapse to the target sequence after removing blanks and duplicates. The loss is then used to update the model weights.
- **Decoding**: At inference time, a greedy decoder is used to select the most likely character at each time step, removing blanks and duplicates to produce the final prediction.
- **In This Project**: CTC loss is used to train the CRNN model on Hindi text, allowing it to predict sequences of characters without requiring explicit character segmentation. The formula for CTC loss is illustrated below:

## Training

You can train the CRNN models for handwritten (HWT) or rendered text recognition using the provided training scripts in the `train/` directory. The models are saved with a date suffix in the format `<model_name>_<YYYYMMDD>.pth` (e.g., `HWT_recognition_model_20250518.pth`). The training scripts use early stopping based on validation loss and save the model only when a new best accuracy is achieved.

### Training Handwritten Hindi Word Recognition (HWT)

Use `train/HWT_V2_modified.py` to train the model for handwritten Hindi words. The dataset is expected in the `data/HindiSeg/` directory with `train.txt` and `val.txt` files.

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
python train/HWT_V2_modified.py --epochs <num_epochs> --patience <patience> --save_path <path_to_save_model>
```

- `--epochs`: Number of epochs to train (default: 50).
- `--patience`: Number of epochs to wait for improvement before early stopping (default: 5).
- `--save_path`: Directory to save the trained model (default: `webapp/essential/models/`).

**Example:**
```bash
python train/HWT_V2_modified.py --epochs 30 --patience 3 --save_path ./webapp/essential/models/
```
This will train the HWT model for 30 epochs, with early stopping if validation loss doesnâ€™t improve for 3 epochs. The model will be saved as `HWT_recognition_model_<current_date>.pth` (e.g., `HWT_recognition_model_20250518.pth`) in the specified directory.

### Training Rendered Hindi Text Recognition

Use `train/Text_V2_modified.py` to train the model for rendered Hindi text. The dataset is expected in the `data/SplitDataset/` directory with `train.txt` and `val.txt` files.

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
python train/Text_V2_modified.py --epochs <num_epochs> --patience <patience> --save_path <path_to_save_model>
```

- `--epochs`: Number of epochs to train (default: 25).
- `--patience`: Number of epochs to wait for improvement before early stopping (default: 5).
- `--save_path`: Directory to save the trained model (default: `webapp/essential/models/`).

**Example:**
```bash
python train/Text_V2_modified.py --epochs 20 --patience 4 --save_path ./webapp/essential/models/
```
This will train the rendered text model for 20 epochs, with early stopping if validation loss doesnâ€™t improve for 4 epochs. The model will be saved as `Text_recognition_model_<current_date>.pth` (e.g., `Text_recognition_model_20250518.pth`) in the specified directory.
